			<p>
				Maybe we could make it all right <br>
				We could make it better sometime <br>
				Maybe we could make it happen, baby <br>
			</p>
			<p>
				We could keep trying <br>
				But things will never change <br>
				So I don't look back <br>
				Still I'm dying with every step I take <br>
				But I don't look back <br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Just a little, little bit better <br>
				Good enough to waste some time <br>
				Tell me would it make you happy, baby <br>
			</p>
			<p>
				We could keep trying <br>
				But things will never change <br>
				So I don't look back <br>
				Still I'm dying with every step I take <br>
				But I don't look back <br>
			</p>
			<p>
				We could keep trying <br>
				But things will never change <br>
				So I don't look back <br>
				Still I'm dying with every step I take <br>
				But I don't look back <br>
			</p>
			<p>
				And it hurts with every heartbeat <br>
				And it hurts with every heartbeat <br>
				And it hurts with every heartbeat <br>
